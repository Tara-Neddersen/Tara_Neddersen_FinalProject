# BIOS 278 Final Project Test Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains sample neuroimaging data for testing and demonstrating 
reproducible preprocessing pipelines. The data is from the ABIDE dataset 
(Stanford site) and has been organized according to the BIDS (Brain Imaging 
Data Structure) standard.

## Dataset Information

- **Source**: ABIDE dataset, Stanford site
- **Subjects**: 1 (sub-0051160)
- **Modalities**: T1w anatomical MRI
- **Format**: BIDS 1.9.0
- **Purpose**: Educational use for BIOS 278 final project

## Data Structure

```
sub-0051160/
└── anat/
    ├── sub-0051160_T1w.nii.gz    # T1-weighted anatomical image
    └── sub-0051160_T1w.json      # Metadata sidecar file
```

## Usage

This dataset is intended for educational purposes in the BIOS 278 course 
final project. It demonstrates BIDS-compliant data organization for 
neuroimaging preprocessing pipelines.

The T1w image can be used for preprocessing steps such as:
- Brain extraction (skull stripping)
- Bias field correction
- Image normalization
